R32BKUR1JYFWNN,"To Buying a Printer we check brand, features, quality & warrenty in this Hp Deskjet printer initial cost of this printer is low as compare to operating cost. I purchase this printer for 2,499/- in Diwali Offer but cartridge price is very high when I want to change it is approximately 2500 for black and for colors. After making some jugaad's I try to refill there cartridges with watching some youtube videos. But lead to loss of printer head and leakeage of inks into printer. I personally recommend to buy inkjet or laserjet printer for better experience and long run for this initial cost is high but in future operating cost will be low.CAUTION: hp ink catridges are infamous for ink level reuction from 100% to 20% just after printing 5 color picture in glossy paperBEFORE BUYING THIS PRINTER CONSIDER THE ABOVE.THE RIDICULOUS REDUCTION IN INK LEVEL OCCURS DUE TOINK DRYING IN CATRIDGEOR DUE TO USING ALREADY USED COUNTERFEIT CATRIDGESMAJOR CAUSE IS INK DRYING, THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF YOU BUY FROM OFFICIAL HP STOREALMOST 50% OF ALL HP INK CATRIDGES REVIEWS TELL THATSO IT MEANS 50% chance that you will recieve a catrige that will print 10 pages rather than 60 pagesIT IS BETTER IF YOU SEE THOSE REVIEWS FROM AMAZON YOURSELVES, INK COLOR 805, 805XL, TRI COLOR AND BLACKAfter printing 5 glossy paper color photo ink level of pre-installed catridges reduced from 100% to 20 %Photo print max resolution 1200 x 1200 dpiUses tri color hp 805 and black inkColor catrige are cheaper than canon but can print 1\5th that of other company catridgesDirect scan and print without pc....yes 600x300 dpiWireless......

R3ISJ8CCMTYJ6J,1) In every 2 to 3 months you need to change cartridge2) refill the cartridge repeatedly3) while refilling colour spread in your hands on table4) Youtuber says caterer issue will be resolve but that's not fact.5) you can't connect ink tank in this printer.6) colour print is not appropriate according to the HP shows in the advertisement
R1A4W90ISK1SSC,Best for home use
R38KWTP9XS2O0X,"reduced 2 starts because sometimes the print colour is not the colour we want especially ivory and all.too much ink usage when printing black pics like a blackboard on pic and paper is kinda hard to insert, Other ways the printer is satisfied for emergency use.note : i didn't try scanner yet"
R1C2W2X86QGLBP,Nice product.
RB75Y0Z2N5RVY,Black cartridge emptied after printing 23 pages
R37H79FGVNLI6U,We have purchased many things from AMAZON. No defects or problem Hence there is no option to say dislikeTechnical support does not arise
R3D35GUVV46MI0,"It is seems like good, once you bought you will face ink consumable and ink cost will be compensated within 5 month, Ho ink cost -850(around), just image of theses things, and if you consider 3rd party ink, that will spoil your printer, Most importantly last April '22 I bought, This March it got mind issue it is not working properly, think before buy, inkjet printers"
R1M7QTLUY0V2WQ,¬†All over the printer is good for home use except the ink cartridge but you can watch the tutorials on YOUTUBE........how to fill ink cartridge.....üëç
RS75FOY13AIG9,"Qualitywise the plastic body used is fragile (like you get a feel that it might break). Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it's very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it's not the best, but not worst also - it's 4.8/5. I feel it's a bit overpriced as well.I connected to my Windows 10 laptop, it asked me to download HP software from Microsoft Windows Store and a few next-next-next things, setup was quick. You just sign-in with your email address registered to HP.It's a 5/5 product but will give 4 because I feel it's a bit overpriced and paper might also get jammed sometimes.Edit (31/01/2023) : The printer sometimes disconnects after 1 print and the pc/laptop stops detecting the printer."
R9ND7QWH7XQYA,Product is ok..it's only for home uses and small official works.delivery very good.print quality ok
R228SX2WEWNRQ0,Its printing really slow when i feed a document to print even in black and white
R37LLH8581A04J,Easy to install and print
R3QVZXMSS2TLR,Very slow
RYZ9YNAV20VMU,It is bad choiceNo value of money
R13BAOX129PB1V,Very good product for normal use.
R1B02USPU5PXG4,Very basic AIO printer.
REGXAONKJNEME,Warranty card missing
RQ8MHNI5JPOM2,Superb
R2G99XUCCMBINL,Very good quality of print. Scanner of this printer is not good. Otherwise wireless connectivity is very good. Color quality is very nice. I recommend this hp printer for buying...
R3OGU8R204QJXI,Refills are costly & printing speed is ok ok
R17XUJX6E6KHAW,"1. Ive had inkjet printers in the past but this one is extremely noisy. It feels like it is cracking its knuckles, and breaking its own bones to transform into a werewolf when it warms up.2. I don't know if it is just my unit, but this printer goes berserk 7 out of 10 times when i turn it on where all the lights just blink non stop and it wont do anything else. And i cant for the life of me figure out what the issue is.Bottomline : there are loads of better printers out there, without all the drama. Im trying to find a way to contacy support to see how to troubleshoot the blinky lights scenario. So far no luck."
R2DMBVOF2OFPW3,Value for money
R2O7I4UED0WBMV,Like this printer and wireless feature works good and gives clean printsüòäüòä
RHQZ8SNXV63H,Does not have a paper tray
R1PCNG1QDCG6IR,Good product
RYQ1WFZFEAOFH,Very Good
RP4BV729OGEFD,"Very Good, it has Wifi, Bluetooth and USB printing options"
R286FU0B9X5QOG,Overall good printer.
R26JG4TVI3SW8Q,Mobile app not working properly.Connect to wifi not easy.Overall good product.
R233L0YU82BPL4,¬†Good product
R11H1SRIDST2I0,HP tank 589 You can trust this picture quality. I can't say anything about the bulid quality for long term. The wifi direct connect is not working properly. Nor the app provided by the company. you should use wire or else you will be pissed
R1KS6G6LRLOJK8,It start printing lines on document after 2 weeks
R2KNJQANLY6UL0,While installation print head error was keep promoting for which complaint raised. More than a week no response from technician team. So product request to returned. More than a week the return product not returned to vendor. Not sure why products take 2 days to reach but the returned product taking more than week time.
R24N5IHU1UXHRR,
R2JLN3GTQULN3,"The colour of this printer - orange stands out in my study room .  Have bought it for my office use , printing speed is quite fast and clear , very silent , plus it has ink sensing feature .Overall very satisfied with the product ."
R1OYO70LMXQ2A1,"Bought it off Amazon as got a better deal.Pros - HP name and product quality. WiFi direct. Wifi printing (2.4 Ghz only). Setup is easy and straightforward.Cons - They claim 6000 pages for color and black Lets see how much it lasts. Even if it lasts 3000 pages it will be worth it.The paper tray is behind the printer output tray and not below it as is the case with most AIO printers. Wifi works only on 2.4 Ghz network. Surprised that only 802.11 b/g/n is supported. 802.11 a/c is not supported which has 5 Ghz bands. Display is quite tiny and black and white. Though it doesnt affect functionality, it looks dated. At this cost, some do offer an ADF (Even lower priced non-ink tank printers offer ADF) and auto duplex printing, which isnt available with the smart tank 585."
R2MBAHBZYBIR10,Really liked the design and looks of the printer. The print Quality is great and the cost per page is very optimal.
R19MYQD7V9HZYQ,"HP software and Mobile App is patheticCreating problems for connection and printingprinter is slowprint quality is excellentcopy, scan is very good"
RUTROAS48VSZA,¬†I didn't like the fact that there was no external Amazon box on this item. I looked forward for the big box which I could have used for storage purpose later.But the printer is impressive. And it was handled safely by the team because so far we have not faced many issues with this.Edit: The printing ink had issues. You'll have to contact hp tech support sooner and the guy said it could be that you get the original product but the cartridge could have been not a good one. So we are having issues with colour prints for the time being. Hopefully the new cartridges help and do the job well.
R2RKF4UB2CKL2S,Connection late hota hai...
R1ZTTIN6QGV0LV,Excellent printer value for money..
RNMB3L6ZT1QAZ,Print is okay... I haven't received CD drive to install my laptop
R26Z5G5C3BUYI,"Highly user unfriendly. Everytime I get the printer ready to deliver a print or get a scan, it's a pain as so far every single time there are some or the other notifications which either denies printing or says 'scan not possible now'. Never expected such a product from HP. It's only the name that sells today.If I have to install and pre-installed everytime and download drivers and firmware and software thus ending up losing almost 45 mins to an hour for a work which should not take more than 5 mins at the most, what is the use of such a product and spending so much of hard earned money."
R1PK34E59YQ40R,"Positives:1) Easy install and use, less weight/handy.2) hp app3) 3in1 is good (scanner, printer, photocopy)Negatives:1) Not value for money for occasional users.I bought it for school online class purpose to take prints but it‚Äôs expensive2) Poor customer care -tech support (launched case number but never get call until I tried them)3) Printer comes with demo cartridges for only 12 to 15prints (colour may be 12, B&W may be up to 16)as per customer care , we need to buy two cartridges separately (Rs1600),4) full cartridges may give less prints as well and no instructions (may be 300 to 450 as per others experience)5) Printer papers auto process sucks sometimes, (not often so far),6) I tried to take small size print from smartphones but size selection is intermittent and only  A4 was option (most of the time)My suggestion: if you don‚Äôt use printer daily, please don‚Äôt buy to save your cartridges cost (cartridges may get clotted if you don‚Äôt use ink often)"
R22YURYTPNP69E,"It‚Äôs a new printer but it does print properly. After running all diagnostics and speaking with helpdesk, I am trying to return the product.The product was replaced and the new one works fine."
R2DLBXIL0DJABL,"Bought the product with mixed feelings due to many negative reviews.After using the product, it appears the negative reviews are posted without any product knowledge or how the printer works."
R2MFAHC9W844UU,"1. Don‚Äôt know the issue won‚Äôt take multiple prints at a time .2. Ink consumption not satisfied. It‚Äôs costing 1.5rs/print .3. Bought new cartridge, price 801 and it CLAIMS 400-450 pages . Which is almost 2rs/print .4. For any restart , Won‚Äôt turn off immediately,takes its own sweet time .5. Some how not happy with the product ."
RHF7KCWNO448S,The printer is extremely easy to install with the hp smart app and wifi .. you don‚Äôt need to physically connect with your pc/mac .. print quality is excellent .. but the ink (uses 682) turns out to be very costly compared to the number of pages it can print in Color ‚Ä¶ third party ink cartridges is recommended
R22MXJR9FTSX7A,good one
R3QSZKSG131E2A,"After few days, the printing quality is has gone down. I would have hardly printed 50 pages, the black ink is almost drained. Printing is coming in very light color.Now even copying is giving blank pages.Need to send it for service just after 6 months of purchase. Will update more once I get it back from service."
R1OUW82T5TPPOQ,"Difficult to connect, very complicated, ink consumption is very high. If print colour photo then ink dry after long time."
R2TZUIUVC38U4K,I brought it on Feb 23 .but now it's not scanning.. pls help me out
R1ZNJJ16MIRF28,"We have always bought HP printers as being top quality but we have made a very bad choice this time. 1) The print quality is poor - faint & slightly blurred. 2) Printing both sides is a nightmare. The user must manually take the 1st page printed and put it back into the paper feed. It is not possible to feed it back on top of any other paper in the feed so you must remove any other paper and put only the one sheet through. It prints and then gives you an error message. Easy to resolve the error but a pain. 3) Printing both sides, multi page document is dreadful. 3 page document - the printer 1st ejects a blank page. It then prints page 2. You must then put in a blank page as, next, it prints page 3 and finally put the page 2 paper back in (the correct way up and way round!) to print out page 1. This is all a nightmare if you do much multi page printing. Anything above 2 pages double sided would be easiest done 2 pages at a time or confusion could easily set in. 4) When printing multi page, page 1 drops down significantly with barely any margin at the bottom of the page. Page 2, however, is right up near the top with a huge margin at the bottom. Don't ask me why! 5) Beware if buying the Amazon ""package"" as we were sent black cartridge 682 & colour cartridge 678. Both cartridges need to be 682.We will give this printer to a local school & buy something else as this product is now, obviously, unreturnable. For us, this has been a complete waste of money."
R2L6K1CFRT09ML,"Colour print me slow hai hi but, B/W PDF print me bhi bahut time leta hai...Baki sab badhiya hai..."
R1KC7BFIU07RFY,"Plus Points1- Start with just power cord,It‚Äôs almost wireless,2- Print quality and build material is too good (With original ink only),3- Easy to install.4- Working on multiple devices like Laptops,PC and Mobile on same time.Minus Points1- Difficult to refill Ink.(Worst refilling system ever I have used)2- Original ink is so costly.3- Printing output is too much slow,Not recommend for Offices and fast work.If you have more time to spare you can go with this device."
RCR48JTCZQJU,"In June 2022, I purchased a printer which functioned well until March 2023. However, upon encountering a problem, I reached out to HP for assistance and discovered during the process that the product's warranty had expired in just 9 months. As a result, I am now grappling with a predicament involving both Amazon and HP.  HP confirmed the printer has been registered with warranty 3 month before my purchase."
R1ZG99R8GRBUGM,Given to very trouble in this printer
R3NO2WTVAZT6QI,"Bought HP INKJET 4100 series printer for home use ,and it's good for minimal purposes and handles smoothly. Print quality is medium and gets blured unlike done in larger machines and toner gets finished quickly for colour than black and white . Sometimes there is issue with the connectivity when we print, sending files through our mobile phones . Overall a good product but lacks certain things as mentioned. Needs improvement."

R2C43LCB00JFE2,Best printer in this range
R1FOYWYZZNG7U0,"Great product by HP.  Old is gold: old model but highly reliable. Low maintenance. Single function makes it super special: just print and no other useless features. #One most important thing i discovered: HP doesn't allow mobile printing feature for this model, But here is a good news, an android app available in good play store ""NokoPrint"" works very well with this printer. Easy to to connect. Just don't forget to switch on OTG port settings.  So, if you were to ignore this printer for non-mobile printing feature, you have a solution now!!"
R25JT9VDD1WUKU,Good Printer.resolve our purpose
R3B3J4YSCGFDMG,"HP Laser jet P1108 was delivered on date as stated at the time of placing order. It was packed in the original HP cardboard box and looks same as in pictures on website. The contents inside included power cord, USB cable to connect printer to laptop/desktop, Installation CD and toner cartridge. My laptop doesn't have CD drive so I downloaded the driver software from HP website and installed the printer. The printer is working fine, print quality is OK. But today is first day so cannot say much. The printer prints one side of paper only if you need to print on both sides than you need to feed the paper manually. I am disappointed because I purchased it thinking duplex printer but actually it is not. Therefore, this review is for those people specially who are looking for auto duplex printer, please don't be misguided. Otherwise the printer is nice. I will post another review after using the printer for atleast six months."
