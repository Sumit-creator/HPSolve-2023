R32BKUR1JYFWNN,"To Buying a Printer we check brand, features, quality & warrenty in this Hp Deskjet printer initial cost of this printer is low as compare to operating cost. I purchase this printer for 2,499/- in Diwali Offer but cartridge price is very high when I want to change it is approximately 2500 for black and for colors. After making some jugaad's I try to refill there cartridges with watching some youtube videos. But lead to loss of printer head and leakeage of inks into printer. I personally recommend to buy inkjet or laserjet printer for better experience and long run for this initial cost is high but in future operating cost will be low.CAUTION: hp ink catridges are infamous for ink level reuction from 100% to 20% just after printing 5 color picture in glossy paperBEFORE BUYING THIS PRINTER CONSIDER THE ABOVE.THE RIDICULOUS REDUCTION IN INK LEVEL OCCURS DUE TOINK DRYING IN CATRIDGEOR DUE TO USING ALREADY USED COUNTERFEIT CATRIDGESMAJOR CAUSE IS INK DRYING, THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF YOU BUY FROM OFFICIAL HP STOREALMOST 50% OF ALL HP INK CATRIDGES REVIEWS TELL THATSO IT MEANS 50% chance that you will recieve a catrige that will print 10 pages rather than 60 pagesIT IS BETTER IF YOU SEE THOSE REVIEWS FROM AMAZON YOURSELVES, INK COLOR 805, 805XL, TRI COLOR AND BLACKAfter printing 5 glossy paper color photo ink level of pre-installed catridges reduced from 100% to 20 %Photo print max resolution 1200 x 1200 dpiUses tri color hp 805 and black inkColor catrige are cheaper than canon but can print 1\5th that of other company catridgesDirect scan and print without pc....yes 600x300 dpiWireless......

RS75FOY13AIG9,"Qualitywise the plastic body used is fragile (like you get a feel that it might break). Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it's very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it's not the best, but not worst also - it's 4.8/5. I feel it's a bit overpriced as well.I connected to my Windows 10 laptop, it asked me to download HP software from Microsoft Windows Store and a few next-next-next things, setup was quick. You just sign-in with your email address registered to HP.It's a 5/5 product but will give 4 because I feel it's a bit overpriced and paper might also get jammed sometimes.Edit (31/01/2023) : The printer sometimes disconnects after 1 print and the pc/laptop stops detecting the printer.",qualitywise plastic body used fragile like feel break provided paper instructions images set difficult new person understand install video link help need search youtube print quality wise best worst 485 feel bit overpriced welli connected windows 10 laptop asked download hp software microsoft windows store nextnextnext things setup quick just signin email address registered hpits 55 product 4 feel bit overpriced paper jammed sometimesedit 31012023 printer disconnects 1 print pclaptop stops detecting printer

It feels like it is cracking its knuckles, and breaking its own bones to transform into a werewolf when it warms up.2. I don't know if it is just my unit, but this printer goes berserk 7 out of 10 times when i turn it on where all the lights just blink non stop and it wont do anything else. And i cant for the life of me figure out what the issue is.Bottomline : there are loads of better printers out there, without all the drama.

R1OYO70LMXQ2A1,"Bought it off Amazon as got a better deal.Pros - HP name and product quality. WiFi direct. Wifi printing (2.4 Ghz only). Setup is easy and straightforward.Cons - They claim 6000 pages for color and black Lets see how much it lasts. Even if it lasts 3000 pages it will be worth it.The paper tray is behind the printer output tray and not below it as is the case with most AIO printers. Wifi works only on 2.4 Ghz network. Surprised that only 802.11 b/g/n is supported. 802.11 a/c is not supported which has 5 Ghz bands. Display is quite tiny and black and white. Though it doesnt affect functionality, it looks dated. At this cost, some do offer an ADF (Even lower priced non-ink tank printers offer ADF) and auto duplex printing, which isnt available with the smart tank 585.",bought amazon got better dealpros hp product quality wifi direct wifi printing 24 ghz setup easy straightforwardcons claim 6000 pages color black lets lasts lasts 3000 pages worth itthe paper tray printer output tray case aio printers wifi works 24 ghz network surprised 80211 bgn supported 80211 ac supported 5 ghz bands display quite tiny black white doesnt affect functionality looks dated cost offer adf lower priced nonink tank printers offer adf auto duplex printing isnt available smart tank 585

And it was handled safely by the team because so far we have not faced many issues with this.Edit: The printing ink had issues. You'll have to contact hp tech support sooner and the guy said it could be that you get the original product but the cartridge could have been not a good one.

R1ZNJJ16MIRF28,"We have always bought HP printers as being top quality but we have made a very bad choice this time. 1) The print quality is poor - faint & slightly blurred. 2) Printing both sides is a nightmare. The user must manually take the 1st page printed and put it back into the paper feed. It is not possible to feed it back on top of any other paper in the feed so you must remove any other paper and put only the one sheet through. It prints and then gives you an error message. Easy to resolve the error but a pain. 3) Printing both sides, multi page document is dreadful. 3 page document - the printer 1st ejects a blank page. It then prints page 2. You must then put in a blank page as, next, it prints page 3 and finally put the page 2 paper back in (the correct way up and way round!) to print out page 1. This is all a nightmare if you do much multi page printing. Anything above 2 pages double sided would be easiest done 2 pages at a time or confusion could easily set in. 4) When printing multi page, page 1 drops down significantly with barely any margin at the bottom of the page. Page 2, however, is right up near the top with a huge margin at the bottom. Don't ask me why! 5) Beware if buying the Amazon ""package"" as we were sent black cartridge 682 & colour cartridge 678. Both cartridges need to be 682.We will give this printer to a local school & buy something else as this product is now, obviously, unreturnable.

The contents inside included power cord, USB cable to connect printer to laptop/desktop, Installation CD and toner cartridge. My laptop doesn't have CD drive so I downloaded the driver software from HP website and installed the printer. The printer is working fine, print quality is OK. But today is first day so cannot say much. The printer prints one side of paper only if you need to print on both sides than you need to feed the paper manually. I am disappointed because I purchased it thinking duplex printer but actually it is not. Therefore, this review is for those people specially who are looking for auto duplex printer, please don't be misguided. Otherwise the printer is nice. I will post another review after using the printer for atleast six months.",hp laser jet p1108 delivered date stated time placing order packed original hp cardboard box looks pictures website contents inside included power cord usb cable connect printer laptopdesktop installation cd toner cartridge laptop doesnt cd drive downloaded driver software hp website installed printer printer working fine print quality ok today day say printer prints paper need print sides need feed paper manually disappointed purchased thinking duplex printer actually review people specially looking auto duplex printer dont misguided printer nice post review using printer atleast months
