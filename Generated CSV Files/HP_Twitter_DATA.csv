Sell substandard products in the name of economy. Such products are designed to fail after the warranty period. Then the after sales service is a joke. @BandBajaateRaho @amitbhawani @RajivMakhni"

1662339699518701568,I had called up your call centre for HP envy 360. I got a info that don't purchase from hp dealers as they sell broken or damaged products which are not noticeable. Is this what HP does in Indian market. #hpindia
1661979467684929536,"@ashutoshjha6 @XiaomiIndia @Flipkart @Dell_IN @HPIndia @Acer_India @ashutoshjha6 @Flipkart @flipkartsupport , flipkart has a best policy. Deliver faulty products, send customers to the service centre. Service centre don't do the replacement. Get out of the situation as customers are made to suffer. And people after paying gets a faulty product."
